   <td><p>A massive black hole is hurtling through space at top speed, leaving behind a trail of stars 200,000 light-years away, according to an unprecedented discovery reported by the US space agency (NASA).

This black hole, whose mass exceeds twenty million times the size of the sun, flows into space and collides with the gas clouds that it encounters in front of it.

By the force of the hole's movement, the gas is later transformed into a chain of stars, which NASA's Hubble Space Telescope was able to observe.

"Expect that we're writing texts behind the black hole as gas cools to form stars," Yale University scientist Peter van Dokkum said in a statement, adding, "What we see is remnants of the black hole."</p></td> <br>

The celestial body is the fourth planet to be discovered, orbiting the small dwarf star M TOI 700. All of the planets were discovered by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey satellite for the TESS mission.</p> </td>

The hole weighs, according to a study conducted by Bell University and reported by the newspaper "Mail Online", up to 20 million suns, and has left behind what is more like a chain of stars, measuring 200,000 light-years, twice the diameter of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>  </td>
