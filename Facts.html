<b class="a" >There is so much about space, our solar system, and the galaxy that we still don't know!  Space is vast. With billions of galaxies and stars, and planets in our own solar system yet to be fully explored or understood, scientists' knowledge of space is always evolving.  There are, however, some really cool things we know about space right now! </b></p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

 <h3 id="s">SPACE IS COMPLETELY SILENT</h3>
<p >Many will have heard the expression that in space, no one can hear you scream.
Like many others before you, you may have simply accepted this as the truth without thinking much more on the topic. Some may have even delved further and learned that space is silent because sound cannot travel through a vacuum.
While both of these things are true, have you ever wondered why? There is no atmosphere in space, which means that sound has no medium or way to travel to be heard. </p>
<br><br>

<h3 id="p">PLANET MADE OF DIAMONDS</h3>
<p >There is a planet made of diamonds twice the size of earth The "super earth," aka 55 Cancri e, is most likely covered in graphite and diamond.Paying a visit to that planet would probably pay for the $12 million dollar space suit needed to get there!</p>
<br><br>

<h3 id="a">A LIGHT-YEAR IS THE DISTANCE COVERED BY LIGHT IN A SINGLE YEAR</h3>
<p >Light moves at the velocity of about 186,411 miles (300,000 km) a second.
So one light-year equates to roughly 5,903,026,326,255 miles!</p>

<br><br>

<h3 id="c">COLOR OF SUNSET ON MARS</h3>
<p >Just as colors are made more dramatic in sunsets on Earth, sunsets on Mars, according to NASA, would appear bluish to human observers watching from the red planet. Fine dust makes the blue near the Sun's part of the sky much more visibilke, while normal daylight makes the Red Planet's familiar rusty dust color the most perceptible to the human eye.</p>

<br><br>

<h3 id="e">EARTH INSIDE THE SUN</h3>
<p >One million earths can fit inside the sun, the Sun is large enough that approximately 1.3 million Earths could fit inside (if squashed in) or if the Earths retained their spherical shape then 960,000 would fit. But can you visualise that number of Earths?</p>
